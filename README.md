# Dandyrow's infrastructure as code collection for Ansible

[![Test Collection](https://github.com/dandyrow/dandyrow.linux/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dandyrow/dandyrow.linux/actions/workflows/test.yml)

linux = infrastructure as code

This collection contains modules and roles relating to my project to define my homelab infrastructure as code to allow quicker disaster recovery and consistent environments to be created.

A key module contained within this collection is the stow module. This allows Ansible to interact with the GNU stow utility. This is useful for installing dotfiles which have been organised into packages which can be expanded with said utility.

## Governance

The final say regarding the direction of this collection remains with me, the owner of the repository, dandyrow. That being said I am open to discussions regarding new features of the collection.

## Tested with Ansible

<!-- TODO: List the versions of Ansible the collection has been tested with. Must match what is in galaxy.yml. -->
 TBT = to be tested :)

## External requirements

The stow module found within this collection relies on the GNU stow utility being installed. Specifically it has been tested with version 2.3.1. This collection contains a role which will allow you to install the stow module.
